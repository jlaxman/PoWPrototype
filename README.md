  <h1>Blockchain Code Repository</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This code repository contains an implementation of a basic blockchain using Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The blockchain is built using Python and includes functionalities to create and add blocks to the chain, as well as simulate the mining process with PoW.

  <h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
  <p>
    The code requires the following dependencies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>hashlib</code>: Used for hashing data.</li>
    <li><code>numpy</code>: Used for array operations.</li>
    <li><code>matplotlib</code>: Used for data visualization.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please ensure that these dependencies are installed before running the code.
  </p>
  <h2 id="data-structure">Blockchain Data Structure Design</h2>
  <p>
    The blockchain is implemented using the <code>Block</code> class, which represents an individual block in the chain. Each block contains an index, timestamp, data, nonce, previous hash, and its own hash. The hash is calculated using the SHA-256 algorithm. The code also includes functions to create the genesis block and generate subsequent blocks.
  </p>
  <h2 id="proof-of-work">Proof of Work Simulation</h2>
  <p>
    The code includes a simulation of the mining process using Proof of Work. The <code>find_next_block</code> function attempts to find a nonce value that results in a hash with a specified difficulty. It iteratively generates nonces, calculates the hash, and checks if the hash meets the difficulty requirements. The mining process continues until a suitable nonce is found. The code also includes functions to generate nonces and calculate the difficulty bound.
  </p>
  <h2 id="create-blockchain">Create Proof of Work Blockchain</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>create_pow_blockchain</code> function generates a Proof of Work blockchain by adding a specified number of blocks to the chain. It utilizes the <code>find_next_block</code> function to mine blocks with the desired difficulty and nonce length. The function prints information about each mined block, such as the block index, number of hashes tried, time taken to find the block, and the resulting hash.
  </p>
  <p>
    To create a Proof of Work blockchain, simply call the <code>create_pow_blockchain</code> function with the desired parameters, such as the number of blocks, difficulty, blockchain array, previous block, and nonce length. The function returns arrays containing information about the number of hashes tried and the time taken for each block.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that this implementation is for educational purposes and does not cover all aspects of a production-ready blockchain. It serves as a basic foundation for understanding the concepts of blockchain and Proof of Work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enjoy exploring the code and experimenting with different parameters to observe the behavior of the blockchain and mining process!
